The reason that the port is of both a historical and religious significance is that in 249BC, one of the saplings of the Bodhi tree, the tree under which Buddha was enlightened was brought to the country and planted, along with a stupa, but today, no such remains are found.
             The Sri Lankan navy has built a replica of the stupa and has even planted the Bodhi tree for the Buddhism followers.
